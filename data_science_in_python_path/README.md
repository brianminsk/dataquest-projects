# Projects for the Dataquest Data Science in Python path #

The projects in this directory, generally Jupyter Notebooks, are ones I completed or I am working on for the Dataquest Data Science in Python series of courses. See https://app.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist

## Python Introduction ##

I am a Python expert and skipped this section of this path but when I started doing my first project in a later section I realized I could do the earlier projects in the Python Introduction, learn a bit about Jupyter, and add these earlier projects to a portfolio here.

### Python for Data Science: Fundamentals Part I & II ###

See [Guided Project: Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://app.dataquest.io/c/112/m/350/guided-project%3A-profitable-app-profiles-for-the-app-store-and-google-play-markets/1/analyzing-mobile-app-data).

This project concerns analyzing datasets on Google Play and Apple App Store data and making a recommendation for a genre to develop an app in that will attract the most users. I added some visualizations and analyses that were not asked for in the project instructions, including scrollable tables using itables and a graph visualization using ipycytoscape, mainly so I could learn about these Jupyter widgets and have a more satisfying analyses and recommendation for the user.

*Note*: For some unknown reason the ipycytoscape graph is not displaying in binder. It *will* show locally if you run this Jupyter notebook locally.
