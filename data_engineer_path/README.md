# Projects for the Dataquest Data Science in Python path #

The projects in this directory, generally Jupyter Notebooks, are ones I completed or I am working on for the Dataquest Data Engineering series of courses. See <https://app.dataquest.io/path/data-engineer>

## Python Introduction ##

I am a Python expert and skipped this section of this path but when I started doing my first project in a later section I realized I could do the earlier projects in the Python Introduction, learn a bit about Jupyter, and add these earlier projects to a portfolio here.

### Python for Data Engineering: Fundamentals Part I & II ###

#### **Profitable App Profiles.ipynb** ####

See [Guided Project: Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://app.dataquest.io/c/112/m/350/guided-project%3A-profitable-app-profiles-for-the-app-store-and-google-play-markets/1/analyzing-mobile-app-data).

This project concerns analyzing datasets on Google Play and Apple App Store data and making a recommendation for a genre to develop an app in that will attract the most users. I added some visualizations and analyses that were not asked for in the project instructions, including scrollable tables using itables and a graph visualization using ipycytoscape, mainly so I could learn about these Jupyter widgets and have a more satisfying analyses and recommendation for the user.

## Working with Data Sources ##

### SQL Fundamentals ###

#### **Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL.ipynb** ####

See [Guided Project: Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL](https://app.dataquest.io/c/43/m/257/guided-project%3A-analyzing-cia-factbook-data-using-sql).

This project is purposed for learning SQL. The project consists of prompts and questions about data from the CIA World Factbook which are addressed or answered using SQL queries. I extended the project by using pandas dataframes to display the query results tables and added some interesting queries on my own concerning country population change and country population density relative to country area.
